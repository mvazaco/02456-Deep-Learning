# DEEP LEARNING IMAGE COLORIZATION

Final group project for the course _02456 Deep Learning_ at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The aim of the project is to take grayscale images and generate coloured versions by predicting the RGB values for each pixel as accurately as possible. Additionally, we intend to compare the results of the colouring process with the original RGB images to assess the accuracy of our architecture, especially when applying various data augmentation techniques (e.g., to prevent the neural network from colouring the top part of the images blue due to the presence of sky in many pictures). Finally, we plan to modify the architecture to achieve improved results.

Here can be found the [project report](https://github.com/mvazaco/DTU-02456-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Report.pdf). Code is availabe in the repository.
